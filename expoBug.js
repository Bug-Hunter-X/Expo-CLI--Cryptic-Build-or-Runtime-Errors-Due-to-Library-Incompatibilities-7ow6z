This error typically occurs when you're using a library or feature in Expo that's not fully compatible with your current setup (Expo SDK version, device, etc.).  The cryptic error message doesn't pinpoint the problem directly.  For instance, if you're using a library that depends on a specific native module that's not correctly linked or installed within the Expo managed workflow, you might see this.
