The key to resolving this is careful examination of your project's dependencies and their compatibility.  Here's a breakdown of the debugging steps:

1. **Check Expo SDK Version:** Ensure the libraries you're using are explicitly compatible with the Expo SDK version you've specified in your `package.json` or `app.json` file.  Consult the libraries' documentation for compatibility information.

2. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that the libraries are installed correctly using `expo install <library_name>`.   Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure a clean installation.

3. **Inspect Library Documentation:** The library's documentation might offer solutions to common Expo integration issues, error messages, or compatibility guides.

4. **Use Expo's Debugging Tools:** Expo provides debugging tools that can help in identifying problematic modules or issues within your app.  Use the Expo Go app's developer tools or the `expo diagnostics` command in your terminal to gain more insights.

5. **Alternative Libraries:** If compatibility remains an issue, consider alternative libraries that provide similar functionality and have better support for Expo's managed workflow.

6. **Community Support:** Seek assistance from the Expo community forums or GitHub issues for the affected library.  Other developers may have faced the same problem and shared solutions.

Example (expoBugSolution.js) showing a check for compatibility:

```javascript
// Check Expo SDK version and compatibility of a library
const expoSdk = require('expo/package.json').version; //get expo sdk version
const libraryVersion = require('<library_name>/package.json').version; //get library version
const compatibleVersions = ['39.0.0', '40.0.0'];

if(compatibleVersions.includes(libraryVersion)){
  console.log('Library is compatible!');
}else{
  console.error('Library is incompatible. Update library or Expo SDK');
}
```
